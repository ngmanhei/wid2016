### Requirements: software

1. Requirements for `Caffe` and `pycaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))

  **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers!

  ```make
  # In your Makefile.config, make sure to have this line uncommented
  WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
  # Unrelatedly, it's also recommended that you use CUDNN
  USE_CUDNN := 1
  ```

  You can download my [Makefile.config](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/fast-rcnn-data/Makefile.config) for reference.
2. Python packages you might not have: `cython`, `python-opencv`, `easydict`
3. [Optional] MATLAB is required for **official** PASCAL VOC evaluation only. The code now includes unofficial Python evaluation code.

### Requirements: hardware

1. For training smaller networks (ZF, VGG_CNN_M_1024) a good GPU (e.g., Titan, K20, K40, ...) with at least 3G of memory suffices
2. For training Fast R-CNN with VGG16, you'll need a K40 (~11G of memory)
3. For training the end-to-end version of Faster R-CNN with VGG16, 3G of GPU memory is sufficient (using CUDNN)

### Installation (sufficient for the demo)

1. Clone the Faster R-CNN repository
  ```Shell
  # Make sure to clone with --recursive
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/ngmanhei/wid2016.git
  ```

2. We'll call the directory that you cloned Faster R-CNN into `FRCN_ROOT`

   *Ignore notes 1 and 2 if you followed step 1 above.*

   **Note 1:** If you didn't clone Faster R-CNN with the `--recursive` flag, then you'll need to manually clone the `caffe-fast-rcnn` submodule:
    ```Shell
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
    **Note 2:** The `caffe-fast-rcnn` submodule needs to be on the `faster-rcnn` branch (or equivalent detached state). This will happen automatically *if you followed step 1 instructions*.

3. Build the Cython modules
    ```Shell
    cd $FRCN_ROOT/lib
    make
    ```

4. Build Caffe and pycaffe
    ```Shell
    cd $FRCN_ROOT/caffe-fast-rcnn
    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:
    #   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html

    # If you're experienced with Caffe and have all of the requirements installed
    # and your Makefile.config in place, then simply do:
    make -j8 && make pycaffe
    ```

5. Download pretrained models and data

    ask me to get models and data
    
    the data should be put in `$FRCN_ROOT/data` folder

To train and test a Faster R-CNN detector using the **approximate joint training** method, use `experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh`.
Output is written underneath `$FRCN_ROOT/output`.

```Shell
cd $FRCN_ROOT
./experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh [GPU_ID] [NET] [--set ...]
# GPU_ID is the GPU you want to train on
# NET in {ZF, VGG_CNN_M_1024, VGG16} is the network arch to use
# --set ... allows you to specify fast_rcnn.config options, e.g.
#   --set EXP_DIR seed_rng1701 RNG_SEED 1701
```

This method trains the RPN module jointly with the Fast R-CNN network, rather than alternating between training the two. It results in faster (~ 1.5x speedup) training times and similar detection accuracy. See these [slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtr4yd4i5e0vw8g/iccv15_tutorial_training_rbg.pdf?dl=0) for more details.

Artifacts generated by the scripts in `tools` are written in this directory.

Trained Fast R-CNN networks are saved under:

```
output/<experiment directory>/<dataset name>/
```

Test outputs are saved under:

```
output/<experiment directory>/<dataset name>/<network snapshot name>/
```
